Learn more about the [OpenCage Geocoding API](https://opencagedata.com) on their website where you can also register for an API key. If you need more requests than the free trial allows you can become a customer. 

This code contains two different methods, one for forward geocoding (adddress to coordinates) and one for [reverse geocoding](OpenCageReverse.m) (coordinates to address)
