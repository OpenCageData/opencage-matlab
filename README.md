## Tutorial

YOu can find a [tutorial for using this code on the OpenCage site](https://opencagedata.com/tutorials/geocode-in-matlab).

## Background

Learn more about the [OpenCage Geocoding API](https://opencagedata.com) on their website where you can also register for an API key. If you need more requests than the free trial allows you can become a customer. 

This code contains two different methods, one for [forward geocoding](OpenCageForward.m) (adddress to coordinates) and one for [reverse geocoding](OpenCageReverse.m) (coordinates to address). There is [a tutorial for using the methods](https://opencagedata.com/tutorials/geocode-in-matlab) on the OpenCage site.

This code was originally written by Alexander Dentler and has been uploaded here and
open-sourced with his permission. All improvements or patches are very welcome. 

There are also [libraries to access the OpenCage API](https://opencagedata.com/sdks) in
many other languages including R, Stata, Python, ...
