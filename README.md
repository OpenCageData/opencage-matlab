Learn more about the [OpenCage Geocoding API](https://opencagedata.com) on their website where you can also register for an API key. If you need more requests than the free trial allows you can become a customer. 

This code contains two different methods, one for [forward geocoding](OpenCageForward.m) (adddress to coordinates) and one for [reverse geocoding](OpenCageReverse.m) (coordinates to address). There is [a tutorial for using the methods](https://opencagedata.com/tutorials/geocode-in-matlab) on the OpenCage site.

This code was originally written by Alexander Dentler and has been uploaded here and
